Hot Area:
Correct Answer:  
Reliability and safety:
AI systems need to be reliable and safe in order to be trusted. It is important for a system to perform as it was originally
designed and for it to respond safely to new situations. Its inherent resilience should resist intended or unintended
manipulation. Rigorous testing and validation should be established for operating conditions to ensure that the system
responds safely to edge cases, and A/B testing and champion/challenger methods should be integrated into the evaluation
process.
An AI system's performance can degrade over time, so a robust monitoring and model tracking process needs to be established
to reactively and proactively measure the model's performance and retrain it, as necessary, to modernize it.

To answer, drag the appropriate principle from the column on the left to its description on the right. Each principle may be used
once, more than once, or not at all.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
Select and Place:
Correct Answer:  
Box 1: Reliability and safety -
To build trust, it's critical that AI systems operate reliably, safely, and consistently under normal circumstances and in
unexpected conditions. These systems should be able to operate as they were originally designed, respond safely to
unanticipated conditions, and resist harmful manipulation.
Box 2: Accountability -
The people who design and deploy AI systems must be accountable for how their systems operate. Organizations should draw
upon industry standards to develop accountability norms. These norms can ensure that AI systems are not the final authority on
any decision that impacts people's lives and that humans maintain meaningful control over otherwise highly autonomous AI
systems.
Box 3: Privacy and security -
As AI becomes more prevalent, protecting privacy and securing important personal and business information is becoming more
critical and complex. With AI, privacy and data security issues require especially close attention because access to data is
essential for AI systems to make accurate and informed predictions and decisions about people. AI systems must comply with
privacy laws that require transparency about the collection, use, and storage of data and mandate that consumers have
appropriate controls to choose how their data is used

The Model evaluation module outputs a confusion matrix showing the number of true positives, false negatives, false positives,
and true negatives, as well as
ROC, Precision/Recall, and Lift curves.
Box 2: Feature engineering -
Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that help ML algorithms learn
better. In Azure Machine Learning, scaling and normalization techniques are applied to facilitate feature engineering.
Collectively, these techniques and feature engineering are referred to as featurization.
Note: Often, features are created from raw data through a process of feature engineering. For example, a time stamp in itself
might not be useful for modeling until the information is transformed into units of days, months, or categories that are relevant
to the problem, such as holiday versus working day.
Box 3: Feature selection -
In machine learning and statistics, feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant, useful features to use in
building an analytical model. Feature selection helps narrow the field of data to the most valuable inputs. Narrowing the field of
data helps reduce noise and improve training performance.

classifier. However, when the test data is unbalanced (where most of the instances belong to one of the classes), or you are
more interested in the performance on either one of the classes, accuracy doesn't really capture the effectiveness of a classifier.

Accelerate your business processes by automating information extraction. Form Recognizer applies advanced machine learning
to accurately extract text, key/ value pairs, and tables from documents. With just a few samples, Form Recognizer tailors its
understanding to your documents, both on-premises and in the cloud. Turn forms into usable data at a fraction of the time and
cost, so you can focus more time acting on the information rather than compiling it.

In the most basic sense, regression refers to prediction of a numeric target.
Linear regression attempts to establish a linear relationship between one or more independent variables and a numeric
outcome, or dependent variable.
You use this module to define a linear regression method, and then train a model using a labeled dataset. The trained model
can then be used to make predictions.
Incorrect Answers:
✑ Classification is a machine learning method that uses data to determine the category, type, or class of an item or row of data.
✑ Clustering, in machine learning, is a method of grouping data points into similar clusters. It is also called segmentation.
Over the years, many clustering algorithms have been developed. Almost all clustering algorithms use the features of individual
items to find similar items. For example, you might apply clustering to find similar people by demographics. You might use
clustering with text analysis to group sentences with similar topics or sentiment.

For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
Hot Area:
Correct Answer:
Box 1: Yes -
For regression problems, the label column must contain numeric data that represents the response variable. Ideally the numeric
data represents a continuous scale.
Box 2: No -
K-Means Clustering -
Because the K-means algorithm is an unsupervised learning method, a label column is optional.
If your data includes a label, you can use the label values to guide selection of the clusters and optimize the model.
If your data has no label, the algorithm creates clusters representing possible categories, based solely on the data.
Box 3: No -
For classification problems, the label column must contain either categorical values or discrete values. Some examples might be
a yes/no rating, a disease classification code or name, or an income group. If you pick a noncategorical column, the component
will return an error during training.

For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
Hot Area:
Correct Answer:
Box 1: Yes -
Custom Vision functionality can be divided into two features. Image classification applies one or more labels to an image.
Object detection is similar, but it also returns the coordinates in the image where the applied label(s) can be found.
Box 2: Yes -
The Custom Vision service uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze images. You, the developer, submit groups of images
that feature and lack the characteristics in question. You label the images yourself at the time of submission. Then, the algorithm
trains to this data and calculates its own accuracy by testing itself on those same images.
Box 3: No -
Custom Vision service can be used only on graphic files.

Match the types of machine learning to the appropriate scenarios.
To answer, drag the appropriate machine learning type from the column on the left to its scenario on the right. Each machine
learning type may be used once, more than once, or not at all.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
Select and Place:
Correct Answer:
Box 1: Image classification -
Image classification is a supervised learning problem: define a set of target classes (objects to identify in images), and train a
model to recognize them using labeled example photos.
Box 2: Object detection -
Object detection is a computer vision problem. While closely related to image classification, object detection performs image
classification at a more granular scale. Object detection both locates and categorizes entities within images.
Box 3: Semantic Segmentation -
Semantic segmentation achieves fine-grained inference by making dense predictions inferring labels for every pixel, so that
each pixel is labeled with the class of its enclosing object ore region.

Match the types of computer vision workloads to the appropriate scenarios.
To answer, drag the appropriate workload type from the column on the left to its scenario on the right. Each workload type may
be used once, more than once, or not at all.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
Select and Place:
Correct Answer:
Box 1: Facial recognition -
Face detection that perceives faces and attributes in an image; person identification that matches an individual in your private
repository of up to 1 million people; perceived emotion recognition that detects a range of facial expressions like happiness,
contempt, neutrality, and fear; and recognition and grouping of similar faces in images.
Box 2: OCR -
Box 3: Objection detection -
Object detection is similar to tagging, but the API returns the bounding box coordinates (in pixels) for each object found. For
example, if an image contains a dog, cat and person, the Detect operation will list those objects together with their coordinates
in the image. You can use this functionality to process the relationships between the objects in an image. It also lets you
determine whether there are multiple instances of the same tag in an image.
The Detect API applies tags based on the objects or living things identified in the image. There is currently no formal
relationship between the tagging taxonomy and the object detection taxonomy. At a conceptual level, the Detect API only finds
objects and living things, while the Tag API can also include contextual terms like "indoor", which can't be localized with
bounding boxes.

Topic 1 Question #83
HOTSPOT -
To complete the sentence, select the appropriate option in the answer area.
Hot Area:
Correct Answer:  
Azure Custom Vision is a cognitive service that lets you build, deploy, and improve your own image classifiers. An image
classifier is an AI service that applies labels (which represent classes) to images, according to their visual characteristics. Unlike
the Computer Vision service, Custom Vision allows you to specify the labels to apply.
Note: The Custom Vision service uses a machine learning algorithm to apply labels to images. You, the developer, must submit
groups of images that feature and lack the characteristics in question. You label the images yourself at the time of submission.
Then the algorithm trains to this data and calculates its own accuracy by testing itself on those same images. Once the
algorithm is trained, you can test, retrain, and eventually use it to classify new images according to the needs of your app. You
can also export the model itself for offline use.
Incorrect Answers:
Computer Vision:
Azure's Computer Vision service provides developers with access to advanced algorithms that process images and return
information based on the visual features you're interested in. For example, Computer Vision can determine whether an image
contains adult content, find specific brands or objects, or find human faces.

Match the facial recognition tasks to the appropriate questions.
To answer, drag the appropriate task from the column on the left to its question on the right. Each task may be used once, more
than once, or not at all.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
Select and Place:
Correct Answer:
Box 1: verification -
Identity verification -
Modern enterprises and apps can use the Face identification and Face verification operations to verify that a user is who they
claim to be.
Box 2: similarity -
The Find Similar operation does face matching between a target face and a set of candidate faces, finding a smaller set of faces
that look similar to the target face.
This is useful for doing a face search by image.
The service supports two working modes, matchPerson and matchFace. The matchPerson mode returns similar faces after
filtering for the same person by using the Verify API. The matchFace mode ignores the same-person filter. It returns a list of
similar candidate faces that may or may not belong to the same person.
Box 3: identification -
Face identification can address "one-to-many" matching of one face in an image to a set of faces in a secure repository. Match
candidates are returned based on how closely their face data matches the query face. This scenario is used in granting building
or airport access to a certain group of people or verifying the user of a device.
